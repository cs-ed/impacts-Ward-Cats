# Impacts on Society

Amazon Future Engineers, in partnership with Project STEM, presents CS Python Fundamentals, a course that is A-G accredited as a third year mathematics course.

This course has been designed to offer an introduction to computer science. Students will learn the basics of computer programming along with the basics of computer science. The material emphasizes computational thinking and helps develop the ability to solve complex problems.

This course covers gives a foundation in the tools used in computer science and prepares students for AP Computer Science Principles. No prior computer science knowledge or experience is necessary for this course. With the UC A-G application, the targeted students are juniors and seniors; but there may also be sophomores enrolled in the course.

The course is broken into eleven units:
1. Beginning in Computer Science
2. Number Calculations and Data
3. Making Decisions
4. Repetition and Loops
5. Programming in EarSketch
6. Graphics
7. Functions
8. Arrays
9. 2D Arrays
10. Programming in EarSketch
11. Internet

As this course satisfies the third-year mathematics criteria, there is minimal attention paid to the impact of computing on society. To remedy this, there is an additional (partial) module, Exploring Careers in Computer Science, which currently consists of videos that attempts to showcase a variety of careers that make use of the knowledge acquired in the course. It is an optional unit that is presented as an optional end-of-course extra module that can fill time. The focus of this impact plan will consider how to enhance this module and intersperse it throughout the course, adding in considerations of the impacts of what is being learned; in terms of careers that make use of computer science and also more generally computer science’s impact on society.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

In this portion of the course, the twelfth [College and Career Readiness](https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/ct/sf/documents/ctescrpflyer.pdf) standard will be focused on: *Understand the environmental, social, and economic impacts of decisions*.
- Students will predict how computer science has impacted careers.
- Students will explain how computer science has impacted careers and society.
- Students will research and present about how computer science has affected an aspect of society.
- Students will create a portfolio to compile their learning about the impact computer science has had on the world.

### Learning Activities

There are 12 lessons in the “Careers in CS” module, which consists of a video about how computer science is used, or has impacted, said career. Considering the events that occur throughout the year, I anticipate each lesson looking at a career could take place over two Fridays. During those Fridays, we would begin by having a discussion about a career, and what, if any impact students believe Computer Science has made on that career. Following that, the class will watch the video and reflect on their original thoughts and how the video looking at that career and the impact of computing have changed their view or understanding.

The module considers an array of careers, including data scientists, the medical field, the entertainment field, game development, dance and music, cryptography, social justice, sports, entrepreneurialism, and web design. As the class progresses through the increasing variety of fields that have been impacted by computer science, and see the videos showing the diversity of people who use computer science in their work, students should understand that they too can make use of computer science and make a positive impact.

As a business and mathematics teacher, I like to connect course work to the “real world” and also connect concepts between classes. I will be pushing for interaction and connection between CS Python Fundamentals students and Data Science students, especially later in the year, when Data Science has briefly covered coding, but also in their unit that is an Intro to Machine Learning; which focuses on echo chambers and predictive policing when it comes to ethical considerations. Having CS Python Fundamental students learn from peers about these considerations would be the starting point. I would anticipate the 12 careers would have been covered by that point in the year, so the remaining Fridays could be utilized by students presenting their findings about an impact, or a solution to an impact (a past one presented by a classmate, by themselves, or discovered online).

After each lesson, students will add to a portfolio that will be built over the course of the year. Students will have a reflection about each career field and the impact of computer science. The second part of their portfolio will look at the impacts not necessarily tied to careers; but more felt in society in general; this is where the Data Science collaboration would be (echo chambers, predictive policing), as well as their own investigation into some aspect of computing. It could be another career, social media, or if the class was for it, we could compile a list of how their lives have been impacted by computing—social media, web shopping, gaming—and they could investigate how computer science has impacted that and how those have in turn impacted society. I could see that being a partner project as each group tackles one of the ideas they brainstorm.

### Assessment

At the beginning of each of the careers we will investigate, I am looking for student participation. Students need to give the career some thought and provide a guess as to what connection (and/or how) to Computer Science.

At the end of each of the careers, students will reflect back on their original perspective and the learning that happened from the video and class discussion. This will be included into their portfolio which will be evaluated to see if students are participating in class, and documenting their learning and takeaways.

When students research an aspect of society and the connection to computer science, they will present their findings to their classmates. Their presentation will be assessed based upon accuracy, clarity, and showing their findings about how computer science has impacted that area of society.

Their portfolio will be checked throughout the year and, if the portfolio day does come together, this course will participate and that will provide students the opportunity to share their understandings they’ve gained in this course. Considering the anxiety that may accompany students, I believe this could serve as a participation style assessing as well, as students should receive valuable feedback from the attendees of portfolio day as the students are asked probing questions for the attendees to better understand.

### Outcomes

By the end of the course, students will have created a portfolio serving as compilation of how computer science has impacted a wide variety of careers and how computer science has impacted society—looking at both the positive and negative aspects. Through video interviews and through their own research, students should see the diversity of people and professions that have been impacted by computing and computing’s impacts on society.

The hope is that this exposure and adventure through discovering how widespread and impactful *on their own life* will inspire personal relevance in students; and to help them realize that they are fully capable of choosing to apply themselves to succeed in computer science.
