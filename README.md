# Impacts on Society

Amazon Future Engineers, in partnership with Project STEM, presents CS Python Fundamentals, a course that is A-G accredited as a third year mathematics course.

This course has been designed to offer an introduction to computer science. Students will learn the basics of computer programming along with the basics of computer science. The material emphasizes computational thinking and helps develop the ability to solve complex problems.

This course covers gives a foundation in the tools used in computer science and prepares students for AP Computer Science Principles. No prior computer science knowledge or experience is necessary for this course. With the UC A-G application, the targeted students are juniors and seniors; but there may also be sophomores enrolled in the course.

The course is broken into eleven units:
1. Beginning in Computer Science
2. Number Calculations and Data
3. Making Decisions
4. Repetition and Loops
5. Programming in EarSketch
6. Graphics
7. Functions
8. Arrays
9. 2D Arrays
10. Programming in EarSketch
11. Internet

As this course satisfies the third-year mathematics criteria, there is minimal attention paid to the impact of computing on society. To remedy this, there is an additional (partial) module, Exploring Careers in Computer Science, which currently consists of videos that attempts to showcase a variety of careers that make use of the knowledge acquired in the course. It is an optional unit that is presented as an optional end-of-course extra module that can fill time. The focus of this impact plan will consider how to enhance this module and intersperse it throughout the course, adding in considerations of the impacts of what is being learned; in terms of careers that make use of computer science and also more generally computer science’s impact on society.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

### Learning Activities

There are 12 lessons in the “Careers in CS” module, which consists of a video about how computer science is used, or has impacted, said career. Considering the events that occur throughout the year, I anticipate each lesson looking at a career could take place over two Fridays. During those Fridays, we would begin by having a discussion about a career, and what, if any impact students believe Computer Science has made on that career. Following that, the class will watch the video and reflect on their original thoughts and how the video looking at that career and the impact of computing have changed their view or understanding.

The module considers an array of careers, including data scientists, the medical field, the entertainment field, game development, dance and music, cryptography, social justice, sports, entrepreneurialism, and web design. As the class progresses through the increasing variety of fields that have been impacted by computer science, and see the videos showing the diversity of people who use computer science in their work, students should understand that they too can make use of computer science and make a positive impact.

As a business and mathematics teacher, I connect course work to the “real world” and also connect concepts between classes. I will be pushing for interaction and connection between CS Python Fundamentals students and Data Science students, especially later in the year, when Data Science has briefly covered coding, but also in their unit that is an Intro to Machine Learning; which focuses on echo chambers and predictive policing when it comes to ethical considerations. Having CS Python Fundamental students learn from peers about these considerations would be the starting point. I would anticipate the 12 careers would have been covered by that point in the year, so the remaining Fridays could be utilized by students presenting their findings about an impact, or a solution to an impact (a past one presented by a classmate, by themselves, or discovered online).

After each lesson, students will add to a portfolio that will be built over the course of the year. Students will have a reflection about each career field and the impact of computer science. The second part of their portfolio will look at the impacts not necessarily tied to careers; but more felt in society in general; this is where the Data Science collaboration would be (echo chambers, predictive policing), as well as their own investigation into some aspect of computing. It could be another career, social media, or if the class was for it, we could compile a list of how their lives have been impacted by computing—social media, web shopping, gaming—and they could investigate how computer science has impacted that and how those have in turn impacted society. I could see that being a partner project as each group tackles one of the ideas they brainstorm.

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
