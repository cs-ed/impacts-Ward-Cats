# Impacts on Society

Amazon Future Engineers, in partnership with Project STEM, presents CS Python Fundamentals, a course that is A-G accredited as a third year mathematics course.

This course has been designed to offer an introduction to computer science. Students will learn the basics of computer programming along with the basics of computer science. The material emphasizes computational thinking and helps develop the ability to solve complex problems.

This course covers gives a foundation in the tools used in computer science and prepares students for AP Computer Science Principles. No prior computer science knowledge or experience is necessary for this course. With the UC A-G application, the targeted students are juniors and seniors; but there may also be sophomores enrolled in the course.

The course is broken into eleven units:
1. Beginning in Computer Science
2. Number Calculations and Data
3. Making Decisions
4. Repetition and Loops
5. Programming in EarSketch
6. Graphics
7. Functions
8. Arrays
9. 2D Arrays
10. Programming in EarSketch
11. Internet

As this course satisfies the third-year mathematics criteria, there is minimal attention paid to the impact of computing on society. To remedy this, there is an additional (partial) module, Exploring Careers in Computer Science, which currently consists of videos that attempts to showcase a variety of careers that make use of the knowledge acquired in the course. It is an optional unit that is presented as an optional end-of-course extra module that can fill time. The focus of this impact plan will consider how to enhance this module and intersperse it throughout the course, adding in considerations of the impacts of what is being learned; in terms of careers that make use of computer science and also more generally computer scienceâ€™s impact on society.

## Plan

### Learning Objectives

Describe the learning objectives for the class that relate to social impacts. Consider using Bloom's Taxonomy to identify the types of cognitive and/or affective outcomes (and their associated verbs): https://bloomstaxonomy.net/

### Learning Activities

Describe the learning activities and how they will be incorporated into the class. For example, will they include class discussion, written reports, homework, or exams? Will the activity be a one-time lesson or used multiple times in class?

### Assessment

Describe how you plan to assess the learning objectives described above.

### Outcomes

Describe how your plan will facilitate diversity/equity/inclusion and help broadening participation in computing. Also describe how the course plan will help long-term goals in addressing computing impacts on society.
